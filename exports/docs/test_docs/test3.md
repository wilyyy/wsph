## Importing the `useTheme` hook

To use the `useTheme` hook from the `ContextHooks` module, you need to import it using the following syntax:

```javascript
import { useTheme } from '../../lib/ContextHooks';
```

The `useTheme` hook allows you to access the current theme in your component.

## The `Layout` component

The `Layout` component is a wrapper component that provides a common layout structure for your application. It takes the following props:

- `children` (optional): The content to be rendered inside the layout.

To use the `Layout` component, you can import it and use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Layout from './Layout';

function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {/* Your content goes here */}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

Inside the `Layout` component, the `useTheme` hook is used to access the current theme. The `theme` object is destructured from the hook's return value.

The layout structure consists of a `div` element with the following classes: `flex`, `flex-col`, and `w-screen`. This sets the layout to be a flex container with a column direction and full width.

Inside the layout, there is a `nav` element with a height of `150px` and full width. It contains a `header` element with the text "willy-photo" and a `div` element with the class `col-start-9`.

The `div` element contains an anchor tag for the "About" link and an `AccessibleButton` component. The `AccessibleButton` component takes a prop `isToggleThemeSwitch` which determines whether it is a toggle switch for the theme.

Finally, there is a `section` element that renders the `children` prop.

### Example usage

```javascript
import Layout from './Layout';

function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      <p>This is the content of my website.</p>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Layout` component is used to wrap the content of the website. The `h1` and `p` elements are rendered inside the `section` element of the layout.

Note: The actual content of the layout may vary depending on your specific use case.
