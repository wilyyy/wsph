## Importing the `useTheme` hook

To use the `useTheme` hook from the `ContextHooks` module, you need to import it using the following syntax:

```javascript
import { useTheme } from '../../lib/ContextHooks';
```

The `useTheme` hook allows you to access the current theme in your component.

## The `Layout` component

The `Layout` component is a wrapper component that provides a common layout structure for your application. It takes the following props:

- `children` (optional): The content to be rendered inside the layout.

To use the `Layout` component, you can import it and use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Layout from './Layout';

function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {/* Your content goes here */}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

Inside the `Layout` component, the `useTheme` hook is used to access the current theme. The `theme` object is destructured from the hook's return value.

The layout structure consists of a `div` element with the following classes: `flex`, `flex-col`, and `w-screen`. This sets the layout to be a flex container with a column direction and full width.

### Navigation

The navigation section of the layout is defined by a `nav` element with the class `h-[150px]` and `w-full`. It contains two child elements:

- The `header` element with the class `col-start-1`, which displays the text "willy-photo".
- A `div` element with the class `col-start-9`, which contains two child elements:
  - An `a` element with the text "About".
  - An `AccessibleButton` component with the prop `isToggleThemeSwitch` set to `true` and the text "Dark".

### Content

The content section of the layout is defined by a `section` element. This is where the `children` prop is rendered.

## Summary

The `Layout` component is a wrapper component that provides a common layout structure for your application. It uses the `useTheme` hook to access the current theme. The layout consists of a navigation section and a content section. The navigation section contains a header and a button, while the content section renders the `children` prop.
