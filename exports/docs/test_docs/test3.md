# Documentation for `from django.db import models`

The `django.db.models` module provides the necessary tools for defining and working with database models in Django. This module is a fundamental part of Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, which allows developers to interact with databases using Python code.

## `RandomModel` class

The `RandomModel` class is a Django model that represents a random object in the database. It inherits from the `models.Model` class, which provides the basic functionality for interacting with the database.

### Fields

- `name`: A character field with a maximum length of 100 characters.
- `age`: An integer field.
- `is_active`: A boolean field with a default value of `True`.

### Methods

- `__str__()`: Returns a string representation of the `RandomModel` instance. In this case, it returns the `name` field.

## `RandomView` class

The `RandomView` class is a Django view that handles HTTP GET requests. It inherits from the `View` class, which is a base class for all views in Django.

### Methods

- `get(request)`: Handles the GET request and returns a response. It retrieves all `RandomModel` objects from the database and renders the `random_template.html` template, passing the `random_objects` queryset as a context variable.

## `RandomTemplate` class

The `RandomTemplate` class is a Django template view that renders a template. It inherits from the `TemplateView` class, which is a generic view that renders a template.

### Attributes

- `template_name`: The name of the template to be rendered (`random_template.html`).

### Methods

- `get_context_data(**kwargs)`: Returns the context data for the template. In this case, it adds a `random_text` variable to the context with the value "Hello, this is some random text!".

This documentation provides an overview of the code and its functionality. It explains the purpose of each class, its attributes, and methods. Developers can refer to this documentation to understand how to use and extend the code.
