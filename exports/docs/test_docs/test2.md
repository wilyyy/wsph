# Documentation for PhotoGrid Component

The `PhotoGrid` component is a React component that renders a grid of photo buttons. It uses the `tempData` array to generate the buttons.

## Usage

To use the `PhotoGrid` component, import it and include it in your JSX code:

```jsx
import PhotoGrid from './PhotoGrid';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Photo Grid</h1>
      <PhotoGrid />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Props

The `PhotoGrid` component does not accept any props.

## Code Summary

The `PhotoGrid` component renders a grid layout using the `grid` and `grid-cols-12` classes from Tailwind CSS. It also applies a gap between the grid items using the `gap-4` class.

Inside the grid, it maps over the `tempData` array and renders a button for each item. Each button has a background color of `bg-yellow-500`, a height of `300px`, and spans 3 columns using the `col-span-3` class. It also applies a transition effect and hover animation using the `transition` and `hover:-translate-y-2` classes.

The `key` prop is set to the index of each item in the `tempData` array to ensure proper rendering and performance.

## Example

Here's an example of how the `PhotoGrid` component can be used:

```jsx
import PhotoGrid from './PhotoGrid';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Photo Grid</h1>
      <PhotoGrid />
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

This will render a grid of photo buttons in the specified container element with the ID "root".
