# PhotoGrid Component Documentation

The `PhotoGrid` component is a React component that renders a grid of photo buttons. It uses the `tempData` array to generate the buttons.

## Usage

To use the `PhotoGrid` component, follow these steps:

1. Import the `PhotoGrid` component:

```javascript
import PhotoGrid from './PhotoGrid';
```

2. Render the `PhotoGrid` component in your JSX code:

```jsx
<PhotoGrid />
```

## Props

The `PhotoGrid` component does not accept any props.

## Example

Here's an example of how you can use the `PhotoGrid` component in your application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PhotoGrid from './PhotoGrid';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Photo Gallery</h1>
      <PhotoGrid />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `PhotoGrid` component is rendered inside the `App` component.

## Implementation Details

The `PhotoGrid` component renders a `div` element with the class name `grid` and `grid-cols-12`. This creates a grid layout with 12 columns. The `gap-4` class adds a 4-pixel gap between the grid items.

The `tempData` array is mapped over to generate the photo buttons. Each button is rendered as a `button` element with the class name `bg-yellow-500`, `h-[300px]`, `col-span-3`, `transition`, `ease-in-out`, and `hover:-translate-y-2`. The `key` prop is set to the index of the photo in the `tempData` array.

## Conclusion

The `PhotoGrid` component is a simple and reusable component that renders a grid of photo buttons. It can be easily integrated into any React application.
